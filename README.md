## Run the App 

- Yarn start

## Why did I build it ?

I build this app to learn more about PWA and how to make a PWA app. I also wanted to learn more about the weather API and how to use it.

The project is quite simple, it's a weather app that shows the weather of the city you search for. It also shows the weather of your current location.

For this project I used the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather data.
